Copy SDL-2.0.3 and glew-1.13.0 into this directory.


Correct directory structure should look like:

/ext
  /ext/sdl2
    /ext/sdl2/include
    /ext/sdl2/lib
  /ext/sdl2image
    /ext/sdl2image/include
    /ext/sdl2image/lib
  /ext/glew
    /ext/glew/include
    /ext/glew/lib



! The corresponding DLL files need to be in ../ (or in system32) !
